# Automated Testing

## What do we want to achieve as professional software developers?

* Consistently deliver working software
* Flexibility to respond quickly to change
* Pride in our code

> Consistently deliver working software
> Know that every release will improve the customer’s experience

> Flexibility to respond quickly to change
> If the customer changes their mind we should be able to impress them with how quickly we can deliver what they want. From the Agile manifesto “we should embrace change” and not fear it

> Pride in our code
> The difference between a profession and a job is that a profession requires you to live it, breathe it, and constantly strive to improve your abilities and the wider environment in which you work. Our code is our craft and the ultimate expression of our abilities as a developer.

## "Traditional" approaches to achieving these goals

* Manual testing
* Code reviews
* Documentation

> All very time-intensive work and prone to human error
